# Qt-Projects-Cpp

This folder contains my C++ programs made in the first year of college.
All projects implement the QT framework and have a GUI interface. They follow the MVC (model-view-controller) and DDD (domain-driven-development) patterns.

The "Mini-projects" contains less elaborate projects, usually made in a few hours or so.
